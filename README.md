Individual Project for Introduction to Genomic Data Science Fall 2025
## Overview
My thesis will be written based on a prior student's collected wastewater, recycled water, and surface water samples. These samples have been sequenced and the data is ready to be analyzed (i.e., run through a Linux pipeline and have figures created to interpret data).
I used a subset of these sequences (10 out of 127) and ran the first two steps of my pipeline: fastqc and multiqc. Descriptions are below.

# 1. Fastqc
